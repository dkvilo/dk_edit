# WebGPU Example Renderer

I decided to give WebGPU a try, in this codebase you will find simple 2d batch renderer with texture batching and bitmap font rendering. probably next time i will add uniform buffers and will use projection matrix.

windowing and input is handled with SDL3 and surface creation is only supports X11 display (probably ill add other platforms soon). as for the backend i use wgpu (Rust implementation)
